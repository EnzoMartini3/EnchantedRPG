>> Meeting Trent
. MC: So your name is Trent...
. Trent: That's right!
. MC: And you are trying to sell me....
. Trent: A Tent!
. MC: ...
. Trent: I don't get it.
. MC: Doesn't matter. So, how much does it cost?
. Trent: You see, this is not just some ordinary item...
. MC: Oh gosh. You know, I'm not rich or anything.
. Trent: Calm down, young one. Your mundane currency is useless to me, really.
. Trent: So, the way that I like to do business is through trading.
. MC: Seems fair.
. MC: Anything specific you're looking for?
. Trent: Actually, yes. I want you to find me a FLUFFOBALL.
. MC: A fluffoball?
. Trent: No, a FLUFFOBALL.
. MC: ... Right.
. Trent: As I don't have access to your world, and I need those to preserve my well-being.
. MC: Wow, that sounds important. What kind of powers does a "FLUFFOBALL" contain?
. Trent: None.
. MC: What?
. Trent: I just like them.
. MC: ... Huh?
. Trent: DO YOU WANT THE TENT OR NOT?
. MC: I do! Geez, chill dude.
. Trent: Awesome! In order to make a FLUFFOBALL, you will need a couple of things that I'm sure you HAVEROSIANS should have in your cute little huts. This list should help.
. MC: I'm going to take that and pretend that you just said something very nice and polite to me. I will you see you later, Mr. Interdimensional.
. Trent: That is not my name-

. MC: Let's see.
. MC: Wow, that guy's handwriting is abismal.
. MC: I'm assuming that this means I'll need some Yarn, ITEMMMM1 and ITEMMMMM2
