>>> Locations

. Heath

-----------------------------------------
>>> Dungeons
. Specific symbol that will be seen on the screen when a "disruption" happens. (The "disruption" used to be a divine
call to alert all citizens from natural disasters)
. Dungeons give a lot of gold? Spread out on each floor?
. Give dungeons simpler names?

> Overgrown Grove [Gruta Silvestre]
. Match the Symbols Puzzle + (Winged Gremlin that grabs logs and places them above you. Attack him when he lands to grab another)
. DISRUPTION: Elevates the terrain(North), causing logs to roll down and making it harder to walk upwards.
. Shock Damage: 10
. Log Damage: 20
. Rewards: Foxave Nest

> Cloudy Sanctum [Capela Nebulosa]
. Dense fog significantly limits your vision and there are ancient turrets all around, that shoot will down quickly if you get close. Reach the shiny runes to light up the area, and when the disruption starts, make sure to have cover.
. DISRUPTION: Turrets activate flashlights to increase line of sight.
. Turret Damage: 30/s (10/0.3s)
. Disruption Line of Sight: 250%
. Statue Jumpscare

> Flooded Fortress [Fortaleza Inundada]

. DISRUPTION: Water levels rise and the door to the next room is opened.
. Ramming Gremlin Damage: 25
. Thick Moss Slowdown: 80%

> Suburban Citadel [Cidadela Suburbana]
. In this dungeon, you will see a meter above you, that charges up whenever you are not moving. It can be depleted by consuming a glowing mushroom from the first floor, but you only have three available.
. DISRUPTION: 
. Run Over Damage: 65
. Overload Damage: 40

> Briar Thicket [Matagal Traiçoeiro]
. With overgrown moss making the floor slippery and ink attacks coming from all directions, defeating wildvines is
surely going to be a lot harder.

. Wildvine Damage: 35
. Wildvine Shot Damage: 20
. Wall Contact Damage: 25
. Ink Damage: 10 (Also blocks sight for 5s)

> Shattered Reliquary [Relicário Ilusório]
. Everything you see is mirrored! Going to the right takes you left, and going up makes you go down. The only thing that is crystal clear is that your instincs will have to be just as sharp as the glass spikes!
. DISRUPTION: Generates more spikes, and the old ones grow(3x3 and shoot projectiles) then disappear.
. Floor Spikes Damage: 45
. Shard Shot Damage: 25

> Underbound Crucible [Caldeira Subterrânea]
. To empty this huge Cauldron of lava, find and start draining all the refill tanks, but watch out for splashing lava, as things will get hotter and hotter!

> Caliginous Crypt [Cripta Caliginosa]
