>>>> Ores
. Ores can spawn in any cave quarry (or specific cave tiles)
. Trench ores can be found anywhere as well.
. Earthblood can be exchanged for rare gemstones.
. Ores have tiers and values: C tier(80), B tier(160), A tier(320), S tier(640). SS tier(2000).
. Mining an ore will give you a random amount of ore nuggets in which you have to combine a few to make a chunk, to then smelt it into an ingot or refine it into a gemstone. If you are lucky, you may get a whole chunk when mining! Upgrade your pickaxe for better chunk chances.
. At random times, an ore surge will start, increasing your chances of finding ores massively. Having a weather radar will tell you when the surge is happening.
