# Plants have a lifetime mechanic: They spawn with a set age(which increases with playtime) and die automatically
(Player can take care of them or kill directly). Also, instead of spawning directly, they have tiles at which they 
can spawn, and it will take time to grow. Searching plants will grant you seeds (with a timed reset).
